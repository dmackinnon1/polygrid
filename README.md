# polygrid
##Polynomial Grid Division JS library
A JavaScript learning project.
Uses a small amount of jquery, bootstrap.js, mathjax.js and quinit.js.

##Todo
Some refactoring is required:
- revise all of the 'latexShow' calls, removing reference to old remote image generation.
- refactor to separate out the computation logic from some display elements that have gotten mixed in.
More unit tests
Better checkbox-toggle behavior (changing default requires updating two files currently)
